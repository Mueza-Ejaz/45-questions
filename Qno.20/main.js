// 20 .Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
var differentItems = ["Forest", "Mount Everest", "Sindhi", "Land Crouser", "South Korea"];
console.log("List of different items:");
differentItems.forEach(function (items) { return console.log("".concat(items)); });
