// 26 .Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain.
// * If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
// * If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
// * Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.
// alien’s color is green:
var alienColor = "Green";
if (alienColor === "Green") {
    console.log("Player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.");
}
// alien’s color isn’t green:
var alien = "Green";
if (alienColor === "Black") {
    console.log("Player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.");
}
else {
    console.log("Player just earned 10 points.");
}
// * Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.
var alienName = "Jhadoo";
if (alienName === "Jhadoo") {
    console.log("This is an alien");
}
else {
    console.log("This is a vampire");
