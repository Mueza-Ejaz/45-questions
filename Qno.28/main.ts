// * If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is a baby.

// * If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that the person is a toddler.

// * If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 13, print a message that the person is a kid.  

// * If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print a message that the person is a teenager.

// * If the person is at least 20 years old but less than 65, print a message that the person is an adult.

// * If the person is age 65 or older, print a message that the person is an elder.

// Variables ages:
let lifeStages:number=80;
// * If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is a baby.
